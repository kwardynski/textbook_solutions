Write a program that, when run, writes the `Hello, world!` program as its output.

## Solution
Full code in `hello_world_maker.cpp` file.  
I'm going to assume this question is asking to print the contents of the `Hello, world!` program to the console. I'm going to use leading spaces instead of tabs for indented lines, as we want 4 character indents, not 8 like we discovered in [0-3](https://github.com/kwardynski/textbook_problems_cpp_accelerated_cpp/tree/master/chapter00/0-3).
