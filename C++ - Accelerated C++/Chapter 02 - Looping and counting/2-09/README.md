# 2-9
Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers and tells the user which number is larger than the other.

## Solution
We'll use an `if / else` block using the `>` comparison operator to determine which of the two entered numbers is larger, then print to console which one it is. For the sake of simplicity I'm going to assume one of the numbers _has_ to be larger.  
Full code in _comparison.cpp_, when run and compiled results in:
```
Please enter an integer: 777
Please enter another: -10
777 is the larger of the two!
```
