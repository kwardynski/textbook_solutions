Change the framing program so that it writes its greeting with no separation from the frame.

## Solution
The only change required here is to set the `pad` variable to 0 - full code in _greeting_framing.cpp_.

Compiling and running yields the result:
```
Please enter your first name: Kacper

****************
*Hello, Kacper!*
****************
```
