What is the shortest valid program?

## Solution
The criteria for a C++ program is it must have one function (main) that returns an int - we don't _necessarily have to_ return an int but it is good practice to do so. Therefore if we skip the return statement, we can write the shortest program:
```
int main() {}
```
