# Server Process Practice
Take the complete code from _todo_server.ex_ from the chapter 5 source, and save it to a different file. Then add the last version of the `ServerProcess` module to the same file. Finally adapt the code of the `TodoServer` module to work with `ServerProcess`.

# GenServer Practice
Try to change the to-do server to work with the _GenServer_ behaviour.
